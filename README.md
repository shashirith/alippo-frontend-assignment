    <h1>Assignment Details</h1>
    <ul align='left'>
        <li>In this project, I developed a web application using React, JavaScript (with TypeScript), and leveraged the power of Tailwind CSS for styling, as well as Radix UI for enhancing the user interface. The main objective of this assignment was to create a dynamic dashboard that retrieves and displays data from an external API source. I focused on ensuring a seamless user experience by handling null and empty data cases gracefully. The project's codebase is well-structured, readable, and maintains high code quality, following best practices. To facilitate understanding, I provided a comprehensive README with information on folder structure and important project pointers. The GitHub repository is publicly accessible, allowing for easy review and assessment. This project showcases my proficiency in React, API integration, state management, and UI development while emphasizing developer-friendly practices.</li><br>
